# Understanding of expression of IFITM family genes on single-cell level in cancer

IFITM family proteins play an important role in antiviral response. Recently
more and more data have been received about the connection of these proteins with
cancer. IFITM family genes are usually expressed in immune cells, but it is unknown
whether or not they can be expressed by tumor cells.

To study this question various cancer datasets were analyzed on single-cell
level along with healthy controls (I provide script for HER2+ breast cancer dataset (GSE176078)). Based
on the analysis of expression of IFITM family genes in these datasets it was
concluded that they indeed can be expressed by tumor cells and cells of tumor
microenvironment.
